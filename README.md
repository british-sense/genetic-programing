Genetic Programming (GP) is a type of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), a subset of machine learning. EAs are used to discover solutions to problems humans do not know how to solve, directly. Free of human preconceptions or biases, the adaptive nature of EAs can generate solutions that are comparable to, and often better than the best human efforts.
